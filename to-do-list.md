Can you write in this style for the next week? I hope you also wrap the content with code blocks. No need to write about festivals and events.
# some advice
## Zhaohui's advice
The database, network, asynchronous, and multi-threaded programming involved are the most useful knowledge.

In your weekly report to the teacher, you only write what you have done and what you have learned. These are not important. You try to write down what you think about for a week and whether your scientific research progress is on track. It is useless to learn so much, the important thing is to think more. Time in graduate school is short, so be sure to stay focused. Stick to some papers every week.

If you want to specialize in a field, you must at least read a textbook in depth, so that you can think about it and let you know how the many methods of the entire discipline are established based on certain logical principles.
## Teacher Li's advice
要dig in code，代码实验不是voodoo，要会调试代码，知道运行到哪里报的错，为什么报错。比如这个错误，字面意思已经告诉你了它不识别mp4后缀文件，说明没有装或者没有正确安装视频解码包，所以你装一个ffmpeg就好了。所以他不是个bug，更不“神奇”，只是你比较菜（没有批评你的意思，刚开始都这样）。
学会用pdb.set_trace()和基础的print()定位错误，并且理解错误哈。
## Teacher Zhao's advice
注意研究方向的收敛，聚焦解决具体的且具有挑战的工程问题。

一周精读一篇论文，顶级会议，顶级期刊，ccf中国计算机协会，对国际期刊有排名，看a类，，有精力再看b，，，找计算机体系结构，嵌入式计算，，，，三五篇摘要粗读
找最相关的论文，近三年的，先看去年的
b类
TECS ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems 
JSA Journal of Systems Architecture: Embedded Software Design
HiPEAC
International Conference on High Performance and Embedded 
Architectures and Compilers
RTAS
Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications 
Symposium
## Teacher Jin's advice
http://devplatform.cambricon.com:30080/server

先熟悉MLU270-Pytorch模型移植流程（量化、逐层、融合、生成离线）以及相关接口使用，具体可以参考https://developer.cambricon.com/index/document/down.html?ddd=9中“寒武纪 PyTorch 用户手册”、熟悉离线部署代码（docker开发环境中example目录），

可选用YOLOv5进行练手：https://developer.cambricon.com/index/curriculum/expdetails/id/10/classid/8.html。
## Teacher Wang's advice
不可能面面俱到，好比说，
情景一，去了大厂，华为，中芯，不可能面面俱到地干。只会让你干一个点。
情景二，你去了小厂，那就可能出现，你什么都干，那就需要你什么都懂，什么都干。
当前的矛盾，嵌入式智能计算，我个人感觉，它是偏软的。先把知识架构架起来。
一，你不是科班出身；她是科班出身，模拟电子技术，单片机是优势。先去架起来，知识架构，哪个知识点不会再去补。她的优势是学了四年，知识架构起来了。
我现在最着急的是把知识架构架起来。再去看学项目的过程中，不会什么学什么。
硬件的浅尝辙止；
你嵌入式、Linux系统搞清楚；找一个开发板，先大概搞清楚框架。
搞清楚fpga，让你验证个东西，你能验证。
你最起码得会一个算法。
不要对什么东西抗拒，可能以后会有用；看完之后，太基础的东西是好，但是要动手；可以从实际经验出发。
这么讲，你到底想去做什么，可能为时尚早，随着认知加深，
你的经历可能会改变你的看法。项目的附加值是最高的。
